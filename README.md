# A simple and generic Django and sveltejs CRUD application

This project is design to work with as many as different data sources type you want.

You fetch your data, transforms it into a python object (I'm using petl as an example) give it to me, I send it back to the front-end.
A config file allows you to configure which user has READ/WRITE/UPDATE/DELETE access to your different type of data.

In this project users are authentified using my school's CAS url as an example.

How to use it ?
